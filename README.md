**Work in progress**

# Elements of physics

Representing elements of physics using React!

## Scope

I'll be using this project for one of my blog post that I'm writing right now. The theme is acceleration and forces.

Apart from the blog post, I'll be publishing more components here (elements of physics) and also a playground to learn them interactively.
